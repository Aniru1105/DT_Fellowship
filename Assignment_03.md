## 🔧 What I’m Building

I’m designing a strategic dashboard that offers **leadership-level insights** for B2B campaigns. It focuses on **conversion tracking, message resonance**, and **persona targeting** using funnel analysis and the AIDCA model. This dashboard is designed to help leadership **intervene precisely where needed** — either in **nurturing** or **targeting**.

## 📌 Step-by-Step Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Define Goals of the Dashboard  
- Diagnose campaign health  
- Surface where funnel drop-offs occur  
- Guide leadership decision-making  

🎯 Boardroom Questions:
- Are we hitting the **right personas**?
- Are our **messages resonating** at each funnel stage?
- Where should **leadership intervene**?

### ✅ Step 2: Funnel Conversion Metrics (Lead → Client)

- Breakdown the funnel into:  
  - **Leads → MQLs → SQLs → Clients**  
- Track conversion rates at each stage  
- Use bar charts + funnel visual

### ✅ Step 3: Campaign-wise AIDCA Diagnosis

**Framework:**  
- **A – Attention**: Was subject line catchy?  
- **I – Interest**: Did intro offer relevance?  
- **D – Desire**: Value proposition strength  
- **C – Conviction**: Trust-building effectiveness  
- **A – Action**: CTA clarity  

- Break down campaign performance by each stage  
- Tag campaigns with most drop-off and diagnose AIDCA gaps

### ✅ Step 4: Strategic Recommendations (From Metrics → Action)

- Based on funnel & AIDCA data, recommend:
  - Rewriting messages (Desire/Conviction issues)
  - Retargeting personas
  - Leadership follow-up on hot leads
- Design a card-based layout for each decision point:
  - **Metric Triggered → Insight → Suggested Action**
