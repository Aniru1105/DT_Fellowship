# 🚀 DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment  
### 🧠 *"Boardroom Lab: Growth Engineering via Prompted Strategy"*

This repo captures my approach to a live-growth simulation designed for DT Fellowship — focused on strategic prompting, funnel debugging, and decision-focused dashboarding.

---

## 📌 Simulation Summary

As a Growth Analyst at DT, I was given a high-leverage problem — sluggish SQL-to-client conversion from 3 major B2B nurturing campaigns.

Rather than just analyze, I decided to **architect**:
- 🔁 Prompts that personalize at scale
- 🧠 Funnels that identify trust and tone leaks
- 📊 Dashboards built not for data, but for boardroom clarity

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering for Mass Personalization  
`Tools:` ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/PROMPTING-AIDCA-blue) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cialdini-Principles-red)

**📝 Task Brief:**  
Design 2 AI prompts targeting B2B decision-makers (like CTOs, COOs) using the **AIDCA** structure and **Cialdini's persuasion principles**, with embedded annotations and a negative prompt.

**✅ What I Did:**  
I built structured prompts tailored for:
- A D2C brand's CTO
- A Pharma SME's COO  
Each prompt includes:  
🔹 AIDCA-stage annotations  
🔹 2 persuasion principles  
🔹 A counter-prompt to avoid generic output

## 🔍 Funnel Debugging via Prompt-Based Diagnosis  
`Tools:` ![VS_CODE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Funnel-Mapping-blue) ![Analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/MMF-Logic-yellow)

**📝 Task Brief:**  
Simulate lead conversion drop-off scenarios and identify why SQLs aren't converting. Write corrective prompts and diagnose where the message misfired.

**✅ What I Did:**  
I simulated 3 funnel lines with:
- Drop-off reasons (low engagement, tone mismatch, etc.)
- AIDCA-stage pinpointing
- Revised prompts with clear fixes  
This let me identify where tone, trust, or CTA needed a shift.

## 📊 Dashboard Design with Boardroom Intent  
`Tools:` ![PowerBI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dashboard-Design-yellow) ![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Decision%20View-Focused-lightgrey)

**📝 Task Brief:**  
Design a dashboard to help decision-makers track if messages are landing and where to intervene in the funnel.

**✅ What I Did:**  
I created a boardroom-style wireframe that:
- Tracks conversion from Lead → MQL → SQL → Client  
- Diagnoses by campaign and AIDCA stage  
- Surfaces strategic recommendations

## 🧠 Strategic Summary  
`Skills:` ![Thinking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Strategic-Mindset-blue) ![Writing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Strategic-Writing-green)

**📝 Task Brief:**  
Reflect in 200 words — how did my prompting and mindset shape this whole exercise?

**✅ What I Did:**  
I distilled how my thinking evolved during this process and how I’d approach this role not just as an analyst — but a systems-builder using AI for leverage.

## 🧵 Final Reflection

> **“I don’t read dashboards. I read decisions.”**  
> This wasn’t a task. This was rehearsal.  
> And I walked in like I already belonged in the boardroom.

Let’s build Bharat — one lever at a time.
