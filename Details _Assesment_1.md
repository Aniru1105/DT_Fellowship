# Part 1: AI Prompt — 5 Sentiment-Aware Email Templates Using AIDCA

**🎯 Target Persona:**
Customizable — for example:
- CTO of a D2C brand (tech-driven, scale-focused)
- COO of a pharma SME (compliance-heavy, operationally intense)
- Founder of a Tier-2 retail chain (growth-hungry, resource-conscious)

---

**🧠 Task:**

You're an AI strategist helping write outbound B2B emails for a growth consulting firm.  
Your job is to generate **5 personalized email templates**, each with a **different emotional tone or sentiment**.

These are not cold blasts.  
They are smart, respectful, strategic nudges — written as if one founder is reaching out to another.

---

**📌 Here's how to do it:**

### 1. **Context Enrichment**
Before writing each email:
- Simulate looking up the recipient’s **LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or company website**
- Extract any **emotional signal**: frustration, ambition, hiring freeze, product launch, etc.

This is to make the emails **feel deeply personal and relevant**, not templated.

---

### 2. **Structure using the AIDCA Framework:**
Each email should follow this flow:

- **''Attention''** – Hook them with a sharp insight or industry-specific tension  
- **''Interest''** – Briefly explain how this tension affects their company/role  
- **''Desire''** – Paint a better future enabled by our solution  
- **''Conviction''** – Mention social proof: trusted clients, results, numbers  
- **''Action''** – Close with a clear, low-commitment CTA (e.g., ''Would it make sense to explore this over a 15-min call?'')

---

### 3. **Sentiment Angle**
Write 5 versions — each based on a different emotional tone:

1. **''Ambition''** – ''You're on the edge of something big. Let’s help you scale smart.''
2. **''Frustration''** – ''We see the bottlenecks. Here's how others are unblocking growth.''
3. **''Curiosity''** – ''You might be overlooking a powerful growth lever.''
4. **''Reciprocity''** – ''We’ve prepared something custom for your team — no strings attached.''
5. **''Urgency''** – ''Your competitor is already moving fast on this. Don’t get left behind.''

---

### 4. **Use Cialdini’s Persuasion Principles**
In each email, naturally include at least **2 of these**:
- **Authority** – ''Trusted by 100+ B2B brands''
- **Reciprocity** – ''This is something we created just for you''
- **Scarcity** – ''Limited capacity this quarter''
- **Social Proof** – ''Used by companies like X, Y, Z''
- **Liking** – ''Noticed you're active in… thought this might help''
- **Commitment** – ''Since you've already downloaded our X…''

---

### 5. **What to Avoid (Negative Prompting):**
Please do **not**:
- Use a robotic or overly formal tone
- Include fluffy stats or broad claims with no context
- Push for a sale — this is about conversation, not conversion

---
### 6. **Prompt For AI :**
<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 20px; border-radius: 4px; background-color: #f8f9fa; font-family: 'Georgia', serif; color: #333;">

<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">🧠 AI PROMPT 1</h1>

<h3>🎯 Persona:</h3>
<p>Customizable — based on B2B role (e.g., CTO of a D2C brand, COO of a Pharma SME, etc.)</p>

<h3>🔤 Detail:</h3>
<p>You are an AI content strategist trained in outbound B2B communication.</p>
<p>Generate <strong>5 different outbound email templates</strong>, each with a <strong>unique sentiment orientation</strong> (e.g., urgency, ambition, frustration, curiosity, hope).</p>

<h3>🔍 For each email:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enrich</strong> the context by first checking the company/decision-maker’s digital footprint:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use simulated LinkedIn, Glassdoor, website, or recent news data (simulate if unavailable)</li>
    <li>Extract relevant emotional/sentiment signals — e.g., recent funding, hiring freeze, public frustration, mission-oriented statements, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>🧠 Structure the email using the AIDCA model:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attention</strong>: Hook with a bold insight/stat about an industry pain point</li>
  <li><strong>Interest</strong>: Explain how it affects their company or role</li>
  <li><strong>Desire</strong>: Paint a compelling "what-if" future with your solution</li>
  <li><strong>Conviction</strong>: Add a trust anchor — client names, metrics, success stories</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong>: End with a low-friction CTA (15-min call, reply, free audit)</li>
</ul>

<h3>💡 Inject 2 Cialdini persuasion principles per template:</h3>
<p>Choose from: Authority, Scarcity, Reciprocity, Social Proof, Liking, Commitment</p>

<h3>🚫 Avoid:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Robotic or overly generic tone</li>
  <li>Irrelevant jargon or AI clichés</li>
  <li>Hard-sell or desperate language</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧠 Use emotional tone-matching:</h3>
<p>Each of the 5 emails should reflect a <strong>different psychological or emotional entry point</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Ambition</strong> – "You’re on the verge of scaling — here’s your edge"</li>
  <li><strong>Frustration</strong> – "We noticed common challenges — here’s how to ease it"</li>
  <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> – "You might be missing a hidden opportunity"</li>
  <li><strong>Gratitude/Reciprocity</strong> – "We’ve created something just for you"</li>
  <li><strong>Urgency/Scarcity</strong> – "Your competitor just solved this. Here’s how you can, too"</li>
</ol>

<h3>🎯 Goal:</h3>
<p>These should feel like personalized value offers from a <strong>strategic peer</strong>, not marketing blasts.</p>

</div>

## 🎯 Persona:
A small-town retail founder running a chain of 7-10 outlets. Driven by ambition, wary of consultant-speak, and prefers direct, action-oriented help.

## 🔤 AI Prompt 02 – For a Founder of a Tier-2 Retail Chain

Write an outbound B2B email to a **founder of a Tier-2 retail chain**.

Use the **AIDCA model**:

- **Attention**: Begin with a ground-level pain: "Margins shrink fast when inventory runs slow"
- **Interest**: Show how local chains are missing easy wins (like smart restocking or loyalty tracking)
- **Desire**: Describe what 15% better inventory turns or repeat sales could look like
- **Conviction**: Mention similar clients in Tier-2 (e.g., “We worked with a 9-store chain in Gwalior”)
- **Action**: Offer a free diagnostic: “Want us to send a 2-page ops scan for free?”

Use **Cialdini Principles**:
- **Liking**: “I’m from Indore — grew up around family-run stores like yours”
- **Reciprocity**: “Happy to audit your POS data for free and share insights”

Sentiment Angle: **Relatability + Local Trust**  
Tone: **Straight, no-buzzword, helpful founder voice**

Avoid:
- Overly formal or “MBA-style” messaging
- Charts, links, or tools in the first email
- Any hint of “we know better than you”


---

### ✅ Final Output
Each of the 5 emails should:
- Feel human and tailored
- Have a clear AIDCA structure

- Contain 2 persuasion principles

Deliver the 5 emails in markdown format.
