# 📊 PART 1: Understand What I’m Building

Hi everyone, here’s what I’m working on:

I’m creating a Power BI dashboard to track how our B2B outreach campaigns perform at each funnel stage and identify where we need to improve.

## The key questions I want to answer are:

| Business Question           | What Dashboard Section Will Help?  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Are we targeting the right people? | Persona + Funnel metrics          |
| Is our message working?            | AIDCA Diagnosis                  |
| Where should we fix things?        | Strategic Recommendations       |

This setup will help us stay focused on improving our campaigns step by step.

These tools help me create, build, and submit the dashboard effectively.
